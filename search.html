We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.",

            "content": "Ghost uses a language called Markdown to format text.When you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown    shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document. The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you    can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as    possible. You'll also notice that there's a ? icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.For now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order    to see all the Markdown we've used.Formatting textThe most common shortcuts are of course, bold text, italic text, and hyperlinks. These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the    characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.    CMD/Ctrl + B for Bold    CMD/Ctrl + I for Italic    CMD/Ctrl + K for a Link    CMD/Ctrl + H for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)With just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted    story.Inserting imagesImages in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)Most Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar    at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor.    Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.Important Note: Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good        idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files before uploading them to Ghost.Making listsLists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of    characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use    * or - or +. Like this:    Crack the eggs over a bowl    Whisk them together    Make an omelleteor    Remember to buy milk    Feed the cat    Come up with idea for next storyAdding quotesWhen you want to pull out a particularly good except in the middle of a piece, you can use &gt; at the    beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.    A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being        madeAll themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times    you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes    sparingly.Dividing things upIf you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from    each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping --- on a new line will create a    sleak divider, anywhere you want it.This should get you going with the vast majority of what you need to do in the editor, but if you're still curious    about more advanced tips then check out the Advanced Markdown Guide - or if you'd    rather learn about how Ghost taxononomies work, we've got a overview of how to use Ghost        tags.",

            "content": "Ghost has a single, powerful organisational taxonomy, called tags.It doesn't matter whether you want to call them categories, tags, boxes, or anything else. You can think of Ghost    tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of    related content.Basic taggingWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you    might tag some posts with News and other posts with Cycling, which would create two    distinct categories of content listed on /tag/news/ and /tag/cycling/, respectively.If you tag a post with both News and Cycling - then it appears in both sections.Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages,    their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.The primary tagInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given    the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So    you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags    which are less important.News, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme SportsIn this example, News is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will    also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.Private tagsSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the    theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of    the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could    use private tags to tell your theme what to do.News, Cycling, #videoHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News, and Cycling - but it    would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video.In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:{{#post}}    {{#has tag=&quot;#video&quot;}}        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...    {{else}}        ...regular markup for a post...    {{/has}}{{/post}}You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive theme documentation.",

Authors can write posts, edit their own posts, and publish their own    posts. Authors are trusted users. If you don't trust users to be allowed to publish their own    posts, you shouldn't invite them to Ghost admin.EditorsEditors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and    publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new authors to the site.AdministratorsThe top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can    do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full    access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.The OwnerThere is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an    Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will    have access to additional special settings if applicable — for example, billing details, if using Ghost(Pro).It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will    populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their    design.",

Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of    code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:.my-link {    text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Prism.js.Full bleed imagesOne neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a    #hash value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special    styling. For example:which is styled with...img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {    max-width: 100vw;}This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge    of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with    if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.Reference listsThe quick brown fox, jumped over the        lazy dog.Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite    reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain    full separation between content and its source or reference.Creating footnotesThe quick brown fox[1] jumped over the lazy dog[2].Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add    footnote content to the very end of your post.Full HTMLPerhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the    Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an    example:                        Foxes are red ↩︎                            Dogs are usually not red ↩︎            ",

However, Ghost can also be completely themed to suit your needs.    Rather than just giving you a few basic settings which act as a poor proxy for code, we just let you write code.There are a huge range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can get from the Ghost Theme Marketplace, or you can simply create your own from scratch.    Anyone can write a completely custom Ghost theme, with just some solid knowledge of HTML and CSSGhost themes are written with a templating language called handlebars, which has a bunch of dynamic helpers to insert    your data into template files. Like , for example, outputs the name of the current    author.The best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at the source code for Casper, which is heavily commented and should    give you a sense of how everything fits together.    default.hbs is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this file unless specifically        told to use a different template.    post.hbs is the file used in the context of viewing a post.    index.hbs is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.    and so onWe've got full and extensive theme documentation which outlines    every template file, context and helper that you can use.If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or help, there's also a    #themes channel in our public Slack community which we always    recommend joining!",
